## 📖 About

The Liberty Township Parks App was born from a real community need: reducing conflicts between park users while increasing engagement with Liberty Township's 7 beautiful parks. What started as a solution to help coordinate cross-country runners and dog walkers at Liberty Park has evolved into a comprehensive platform serving multiple townships.

### The Problem We're Solving

- **No centralized communication** - Residents don't know what's happening at parks or where
- **Navigation difficulties** - First-time visitors struggle to find amenities (~50% unaware of seasonal features)
- **Maintenance gaps** - Issues go unreported for days
- **Activity conflicts** - School teams, dog walkers, and families need better coordination

### The Solution

A mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) providing:
- Real-time event calendars with exact park locations
- Interactive GPS-enabled maps showing all amenities
- Community-powered issue reporting (Park Watch)
- Democratic voting on park improvements and events
- AI-powered park recommendations
